Inheritance:  No, because inheritance involves creating a child class (that is normally modified) from an existing parent class, which occurs in the class definition.  The class Cart does not demonstrate inheritance, and the method add_to_cart is a typical method that is just updating the total attribute of the Cart instance with the price attribute from the passed MobileDevice or ServiceContract object.\n","\n","2. Polymorphism:  Yes, because the method add_to_cart with perform the same regardless of the type of the argument item, provided the item object has a price attribute.\n","\n","3. Object-Oriented programming:  Yes, because the method add_to_cart is available to instances of the Cart class (a demonstration of encapsulation) and accepts as arguments any objects with the price attribute (a demonstration of polymorphism).\n","\n","4. Top-down design:  I cannot really know one way or the other because I don't know how everything is being designed as a working process.  Top-down design involves breaking down a larger objective into sub-problems that are then implemented.  So if I assume that the high-level behavior has been identified and now the main goal is to implement one of the requirements (namely the behavior in the add_to_cart method), then yes this would be a demonstration of top-down design.\n","\n","5. Functional programming:  No, because add_to_cart is implemented as a method within the class Cart and relies on an object-oriented paradigm.  In the functional paradigm, functions themselves are the main components of implementing code, where they can be assigned to variables and passed as arguments."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"JdTWk7xZg7Ta"},"source":["b) Suppose you have a long list of digits (0-9) that you want to write to a file.

I found **ClinVar** which is a repository that contains expert curated data, and it is free for the taking. This is a gold mine! Look at the file and tell me what gene and mutation combinations are classified as dangerous.”\n","\n","Make sure that you only give your boss the dangerous mutations and include:\n","\n","1) Gene name\n","\n","2) Mutation ID number\n","\n","3) Mutation Position (chromosome & position)\n","\n","4) Mutation value (reference & alternate bases)\n","\n","5) Clinical significance (CLNSIG)\n","\n","6) Disease that is implicated\n","\n","**Requirements**\n","\n","1) The deliverables are the final result as a dataframe with a short discussion of any specifics. (that is, what data you would present to your boss with the explanation of your results)\n","\n","2) Limit your output to the first 100 harmful mutations and tell your boss how many total harmful mutations were found in the file\n","\n","3) Use the instructor-modified \"clinvar_final.txt\" at this link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Zps0YssoJbZHrn6iLte2RDLlgruhAX1s/view?usp=sharing This file was modified to be not exactly the same as 'standard' .vcf file to test your data parsing skills. **This is a large file so do NOT upload it into your github repo!**\n","\n","4) Replace missing values in the dataframe with: 'Not_Given'.

What strategy will you use to robustly extract and filter your data of interest? How do you plan to handle missing data?\n","\n","* A good way to start is to print out each line, then practice parsing them to see if you can recover the fields of interest\n","\n","* A starting solution for parsing .vcfs can be found here: https://gist.github.com/dceoy/99d976a2c01e7f0ba1c813778f9db744 This solution does **NOT** work due to the changes we've made but can be modified to work. As with any solution that needs modifications, it may take less time to make your own solution!\n","\n","* Filter out junk and lines with no mutation data. Just focus on the data your need to deliver to your boss. \n","\n","* Pandas and NumPy parsers correctly recognize the end of each line in in the ClinVar file.\n","\n","* The unit of observation of this dataset is one row per mutation.\n","\n","* This is similar to a task that one of us tackled at work.
