    "## General Guidelines:\n",
    "\n",
    "- In each code block, do NOT delete the ### comment at the top of a cell (it's needed for the auto-grading!)\n",
    "  - Full autograder tests and results are on gradescope.\n",
    "  - You will get the full 100 points from the autograder for this assignment.\n",
    "  - You may upload and run the autograder as many times as needed in your time window to get full points\n",
    "  - The assignment needs to be named HW_Unit_02.ipynb to be graded from the autograder!\n",
    "  - The examples given are samples of how we will test/grade your code.\n",
    "    - Please ensure your code outputs the exact same information / format!\n",
    "    - In addition to the given example, the autograder will test other examples\n",
    "    - Each autograder test tells you what input it is using\n",
    "  - Once complete, the autograder will show each tests, if that test is passed or failed, and your total score\n",
    "  - The autograder fails for a couple of reasons:\n",
    "    - Your code crashes with that input (for example: `Test Failed: string index out of range`)\n",
    "    - Your code output does not match the 'correct' output (for example: `Test Failed: '1 2 3 2 1' != '1 4 6 4 1'`)\n",
    "- Please format your input and output strings to be user friendly. See Module 2.12.2. For example, in the first problem below, format the tip to two decimal places like 15.25 instead of 15.25000001.\n",
    "- Limited user input validation and error checking is encouraged on this assignment. Each question below will indicate the type of input that you can expect. (for example, if the question states the input will be an integer you can expect the user to input an integer and do not need to check to ensure it is an integer versus a float or a string)\n",
    "- Adding comments in your code is strongly suggested but won't be graded.\n",
    "- The examples given are samples of how we will test/grade your code. Please ensure your scripts output the same information.\n",
    "- If you are stuck on a problem or do not understand a question - please come to office hours or ask questions to the class Google group (please don't post your code though). If it is a coding problem send a private email to all of the instructors at: mids-python-instructors@googlegroups.com.\n",
    "- We also have a TA tutors for extra help and 1 on 1 sessions!\n",
    "- Hints are given in some of the questions; these are optional so you do NOT need to use the hint (or code your answer that way) as long as your code meets the requirements of the problem.\n",
    "- You may use any libraries from the Python Standard Library for this assignment: https://docs.python.org/3/library/"
